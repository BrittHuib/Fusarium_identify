# Fusarium_identify
A workflow to identify if Fusarium has Bikaverin

In this project, unknown Fusarium isolates are investigated to determine whether they produce bikaverin. This analysis was carried out partly through a Snakemake workflow and partly through manual processing. 
The quality of the raw sequencing data, the Flye assemblies, and the AUGUSTUS gene predictions were evaluated. In addition, OrthoFinder will be used to construct a potential phylogenetic tree.
